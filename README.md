# RoadBuddy

RoadBuddy is a ride-sharing application designed to connect drivers with passengers traveling 
in the same direction. Unlike traditional services like Uber, RoadBuddy focuses on drivers 
who are already planning to travel to a specific destination, allowing them to offer available
seats to passengers heading the same way. This approach promotes cost efficiency by enabling 
passengers to share travel expenses while allowing drivers to earn extra cash on trips they were 
already planning to take.
